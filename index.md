I am a PhD candidate in Control and Dynamical Systems at Caltech. I am advised by Professors [Eric Mazumdar](http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~mazumdar/), [Franca Hoffmann](https://francahoffmann.com/) and [John Doyle](https://eas.caltech.edu/people/doyle). 
My research is on control theory and analysis of game dynamics using PDEs.

Before Caltech, I earned my Bachelors degree in [Electrical and Computer Engingeering](https://www.ece.cornell.edu/ece) with a physics minor from Cornell University in 2018.

I am supported by a National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship and PIMCO Data Science Graduate Fellowship.

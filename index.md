I am a third-year PhD student in Control and Dynamical Systems at California Institute of Technology. I am advised by Professors [Eric Mazumdar](http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~mazumdar/) and [John Doyle](https://eas.caltech.edu/people/doyle). 
My research is on nonlinear control theory and algorithms for analysis of game dynamics.

Before Caltech, I earned my Bachelors degree in [Electrical and Conputer Engingeering](https://www.ece.cornell.edu/ece) with a Physics minor from Cornell University in 2018.
